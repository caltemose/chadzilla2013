&lt;h3 id="october-2013"&gt;28 October 2013&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Milan recently for the &lt;a href="http://frontiersofinteraction.com"&gt;Frontiers of Interaction&lt;/a&gt; conference and went to the metro station at the Duomo to get access to the city's &lt;a href="http://info.openwifimilano.it/"&gt;open wifi network&lt;/a&gt; (you need an account but it's worth it if you don't have mobile data service). I handed my ID over to the woman behind the counter so she could create my account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to me was a Chinese man trying to exchange metro tickets for cheaper tickets as he'd initially bought tickets of the wrong value. It was clear he did not speak English very well. The Italian man he was working with behind the counter spoke English fairly well though it was not his native language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They continued their discussion and the Italian man understood that the tourist wanted to exchange his tickets but was not sure what value tickets the man wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tourist kept saying "one point fifty" trying to indicate that he wanted the tickets worth 1.50€. This sounded odd to me but I certainly understood what he meant. The Italian man, however, did not. It would have been clear to him had the Chinese man said "one euro and fifty cents" or possibly "one fifty" or even "a metro ticket" (1.50 is the default ticket value). Before you say "seems obvious to me" consider that the Italian man didn't know whether the original tickets were of too high or too low value and it's conceivable the visitor wanted tickets of any number of possible values, greater or lower than the originals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tourist repeated "one point fifty" and "one point five zero." He kept repeating this at louder and louder volume. As you can imagine, the man behind the counter was starting to get frustrated (it's a busy station with a long line of people waiting) and I suspect, as anyone would, he felt the visitor was starting to yell at him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were going south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, as I was just about to butt in and clarify in Italian with the guy behind the desk, he figured it out. And said, in English, "you need to communicate better" in a not-so-pleasant tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn't the first time I'd seen something like this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I will remember to be more patient when traveling and take note not to raise my voice when speaking with someone whose language isn't my native tongue. I'd encourage you to do the same when you find yourself in these kinds of situations. Especially if your voice tends to crescendo as easily as mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to communicate in a foreign language can be frustrating but it can also be a lot of fun. Shoot for the fun rather than the frustration…&lt;/p&gt;
