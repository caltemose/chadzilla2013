        <p>My name is Chad Altemose and I have been using technology to make fun and useful stuff professionally for about two decades. </p>

        <p><a href="/articles">Here you'll find articles I've written</a> relating to creative technology and design. Most recently I wrote about <a href="/articles/2013/10/12/remaking-this-site/">rebuilding this site</a> where I discuss simplifying web development and looking to its future.</p>
        
        <p>I do a lot of research when I travel and have started saving some of those resources including maps of places to go, day plans and other suggestions. <a href="/travel">Check my travel section</a> for more info.</p>
        
        <p>You can find my photography on <a href="http://flickr.com/caltemose">Flickr</a>. Most of it is travel-related.</p>

        I design and build interactive media. Iâ€™ve worked as a visual and interaction designer, developer, educator and manager throughout my (roughly) twenty-year career. I travel slowly and eat whatever looks tasty.
