# Paris: Parc Floral, Le Petit Bofinger, Lot of Wine

### A trip to the park, lunch and an afternoon snack.

The big event for this day is a visit to Parc Floral in Paris ([site](http://www.parcfloraldeparis.com), [map](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Parc+Floral+de+Paris%2C+Route+du+Champ+de+Manoeuvres%2C+Paris%2C+France&data=!1m4!1m3!1d5485!2d2.4453483!3d48.8353945!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x47e672b9da72c829%3A0xf08ec6bbe0a6a45f!3m8!1m3!1d27236258!2d-95.677068!3d37.0625!3m2!1i1419!2i802!4f13.1!4m2!3d48.83494!4d2.448828)). If you're into botanical gardens, flowers, plants and parks, you'll enjoy this. If not, hit back.

Parc Floral is not the main botanical gardens for Paris but I enjoyed it more than the botanical gardens. It is less formal and more organically organized and it was practically devoid of visitors when we were there. If you visit, obviously you'll want to pick a day with appropriate weather.

Our sequence for this day was:

- get up, have light breakfast (home or cafe, your call)
- take metro to Parc Floral (end of line 1, the primary metro line)
- leave park, walk across the street to Le Petit Bofinger for lunch
- metro home, rest a bit, download photos
- head to Lot of Wine (or any good wine bar)

Certainly you could rearrange this sequence to your choosing. And there are other places to eat besides Le Petit Bofinger (which is not the cheapest option by far).

If you are really into nature and floral photography, expect to spend a lot of time at the park. You may even wish to tailor your timing to get the best early or late sunlight. When we were there, there was an international competition of flower growers specifically focusing on the Dahlia ([see some images](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1419&bih=802&q=dahlia&oq=dahlia&gs_l=img.3..0l10.817.1448.0.1870.6.5.0.1.1.0.87.320.5.5.0....0...1ac.1.29.img..0.6.323.Rupu9qHOqcY)). It was a visual feast. Breathtaking.
