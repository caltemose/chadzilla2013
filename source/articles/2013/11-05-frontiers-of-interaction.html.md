# Clif Notes: Frontiers of Interaction 2013

I recently attended the [Frontiers of Interaction conference](http://frontiersofinteraction.com) in Milan. It was my first industry conference overseas. I had a fantastic time, met some great people and got to hang out with some well-known industry folks who turned out to be really down-to-earth, way smarter than me and a whole lot of fun.

First up, big thanks to [Dave Malouf](http://twitter.com/daveixd) for hooking me up with the great people who run or are involved with the conference. I owe you big time.

Rather than write a long description of what happened, why you should attend events like this and what I learned, I thought it might be best to appease your short attention spans and write some clif notes for the event. The high-level view is the conference took place during two days; Thursday was a day of workshops, Friday a day of short talks in the style of the TED conferences.


## Day One Highlights

### Workshop: Near Future Design

I started with a workshop run by Salvatore Iaconesi ([@xdxd_vs_xdxd](http://twitter.com/xdxd_vs_xdxd)), a professor teaching in Florence, Italy. His workshop was "Near Future Design" which is what it sounds like, focusing on design for the immediate future. His clarification was a simple but important takeaway for me: we attempt to merge **what we know is possible** and **what we perceive to be possible**.

Also, noise and randomness are useful for invention. In other words, don't focus your self during the idea-generating process. Let things happen, ideas flow, and be open to unlimited possibilities. You will filter later.

From Salvatore: "The future is a thing we build today."

### Workshop Two: Designing Products with Personality

My next workshop was run by Jeroen Van Geel ([@jeroenvangeel](http://twitter.com/jeroenvangeel)), a Dutch creative director. Here are a few takeaways:

"Not all products are consciously designed." (think HP Notebook, its personality is achieved by accident through engineering.)

Frequently in the design process (specifically digital this time) we have:

- too much: IA, design patterns and wireframes
- not enough: storytelling, meaning and personality

"Flaws add to believability" (in terms of a product; think about peoples' personalities and their flaws which make them seem more human.)

### Workshop Three: Mega Workshop with Dave Gray

The final workshop of the day was held in the main conference room and everyone attended it (the morning workshops were in smaller rooms with subsets of attendees). It was led by the fantastic [Dave Gray](http://about.me/davegray) who you may know from his book [Gamestorming](http://gogamestorming.com), which you should get familiar with if you haven't already (presuming you work in communication or product design). 

Dave's workshop was a great example of how you can run a successful workshop with a large number of people (200-300). We focused on sketching ideas and communicating visually. Most of what Dave showed us is better expressed through the sketches we created. However, one really important takeaway from doing a breakout exercise where we split into pairs and interviewed each other about our careers was simply this:

**"It's more fun to listen."** (As opposed to talking all the time.)

Remember that. It's a lesson I've known for a long time which helps me grow continuously and expand my knowledge.

If you aren't familiar with Dave's gamestorming book and site, I'd suggest you go check out the site now which has a wealth of information you can use for working out ideas and communicating through basic visuals.

### Wrapping Up Day One

We ended the presentations for the day with some interesting entertainment and nerdery from [Jared Ficklin](http://jaredficklin.com), principal technologist at [Frog Design](http://www.frogdesign.com) who experiments with physics in his spare time. To learn more about his experiments just visit his site. Two important takeaways from his entertaining end to the day:

- Mess with stuff. It's fun and you learn from it. (This is one reason I shoot [timelapse](http://vimeo.com/caltemose).)
- "Things are not always what you are told they are."


## Day Two Highlights

Day two consisted of short talks grouped several themes. Here are highlights from a few of the speakers.

### Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles were the subject of the first few talks. Since this isn't a theme that's near and dear to me (although I anxiously await the day when most humans are taken out of the driving equation), I don't have a lot of notes. However, one thing that Mark Rigley mentioned really stuck with me:

**"Beware the leaky abstraction."**

By this he meant that when using analogies to convey concepts, be aware that the analogy will eventually break. This was a great reminder for me since I use analogies frequently when explaining technical concepts. While they can be very useful, it's important to realize they aren't perfect and you shouldn't hold on to them for dear life. When they lose relevance, move on.

### Fabian Hemmert

I really identified with Fabian's talk. He focused on how we interact with technology and consume data. My first note paraphrases something he said:

**We focus a lot on thinking and not a lot on feeling.** In this case he was talking about how we design technology systems and products. We tend to focus more on the practical.

**"Our body sees parallels between information consumption and eating."** If you know me reasonably well, then you can imagine how much this impacted me. For me, this is a new way of thinking about how we interact with the media and technology we consume.

**"We might just be in the fast food age [of data/media consumption]."** This was a point that Fabian later said most people latch on to when he gives this talk and it's not hard to see why. Think about how during the day we view Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc and it becomes pretty clear what he's talking about.

Another paraphrase: **Maybe we should start living moments without documenting them all.** Think of the various times you see people with their phones out shooting pictures and videos of speakers, concerts, gardens, whatever, or tweeting these moments, when maybe they'd gain more from the experience by putting the device down and just embracing the moment.


### Jared Ficklin

Jared wasn't the next speaker but his content really connects with Fabian's so it's going here. His talk was titled "The Next Pattern of Computing" and focused on removing the computers from our hands and desks and embedding them in our rooms, spaces and other things we inhabit.

**"We are babysitters"** refers to how we carry our mobile devices around and pay them so much mind. Connected to that is (a paraphrase) **when you are looking at your personal device you enter a tunnel.** You are head down and focused and removed from the physical world around you.

For me hearing this after Fabian's talk really made me think about what it is I want to do with technology in the future, both in my career and personal life. It also made me more excited to merge my schooling (architecture) with my career path (design and creative tech). We'll see where that leads.

Another thing Jared said that stuck with me was (paraphrased) **think by making, deliver by demo.** In other words, you will learn more from making things and experimenting than by thinking and talking about tech. Or at least that's how I took it.


### The Keynote: Richard Saul Wurman

Richard Saul Wurman is the creator of TED (which he reminded us is Technology, **Entertainment** and Design) and he gave the keynote which was one of the best talks I've heard in quite some time. He covered many things and here are just a few of his many salient points.

**"You're here because you want to have a conversation with somebody."** I think this is a key thing to remember when attending conferences and really gets to the heart of what Mr. Wurman has done and continues to do with his life's work -- connecting people so they can learn from each other and hear each other's stories (and documenting/publicizing it so we can all learn from the conversation).

When I think about what I took away from the conference, it really did boil down to artifacts from conversations with new (to me) people.

Later, Mr. Wurman said he was no fan of education which sounds harse when taken out of context. I taught in an official setting for a while so hearing that was initially difficult but I realized I completely agree with him because of what he said next. Rather than learning from the top down (traditional/official education) he prefers learning from the bottom up. In other words, learn by doing and experiencing. We all know experience is the best teacher. Adding to that, he said he preferred "curiosity augmentation" -- fostering another person's learning by piquing her/his curiosity.

Mr. Wurman had a lot of other great points and I'll just say that if you have the opportunity to hear him speak, do not miss it.
