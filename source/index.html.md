My name is Chad Altemose and I have been using technology to make fun and useful stuff professionally for about two decades. 

<!-- If you're interested in my career, see the [work page](/work).
 -->

I've written a few articles relating to creative technology and design. [This page](/articles) lists them.

I rebuilt and simplified this site recently. I wrote about [it here](/articles/2013/10/12/remaking-this-site/) where I discuss simplifying web development and looking to the future.

If you want to connect, check my [contact page](/contact) for ways to find me online.
