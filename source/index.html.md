My name is Chad Altemose and I have been using technology to make fun and useful stuff professionally for about two decades. 

<!-- If you're interested in my career, see the [work page](/work).

Occasionally I write an article relating to creative technology and design. [This page](/articles) lists them all.

I love process. Recently I wrote about [the web design and development process](/articles/2013/09/24/site-inspiration/) in the current era of HTML5 standards, the mobile boom and the internet of things.
