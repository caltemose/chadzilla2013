My name is Chad Altemose and I have been using technology to make fun and useful stuff professionally for about two decades. 

If you're interested in my career, see my previous [work site](/work) for now.

[Here you'll find articles I've written](/articles) relating to creative technology and design. Most recently I wrote about [rebuilding this site](/articles/2013/10/12/remaking-this-site/) where I discuss simplifying web development and looking to its future.

You can find my photography on [my Flickr site](http://flickr.com/caltemose). Most of it is travel-related.

When I travel I research plenty and make maps (Google) of places I went that I'd revisit. [Check them out here.](/maps)

If you want to connect, check my [contact page](/contact) for ways to find me online.

[My old site still exists here](/site/) if you want to see some photos or read our travel blog from our 2009 off-year in Europe.
