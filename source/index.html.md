My name is Chad Altemose and I have been using technology to make fun and useful stuff professionally for about two decades. 

If you're interested in my career, see my previous [work site](/work) for now.

[Here you'll find articles I've written](/articles) relating to creative technology and design. Most recently I wrote about [rebuilding this site](/articles/2013/10-12-modern-web-development/) where I discuss simplifying web development and looking to its future.

I do a lot of research when I travel and have started saving some of those resources including maps of places to go, day plans and other suggestions. [Check my travel section](/travel) for more info.

You can find my photography on [Flickr](http://flickr.com/caltemose). Most of it is travel-related.

If you want to connect, check my [contact page](/contact) for ways to find me online.

My previous site still exists [here](/site/) if you want to read our [travel blog from our 2009 off-year in Europe](/site/travelog/) or see some of the [food highlights](/site/travelog/travelmeals) from that trip.
